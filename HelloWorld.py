# in python when working with Strings we can use single or double quotes
print( 'hello world' );

# name = input("What is your name? ");
# print("Hello " + name);

# this will throw an error because it is not converted correctly
# birth_year = input("Enter your birth year: ")
# SO convert to integer
# age = 2022 - int(birth_year)
# print(age)
